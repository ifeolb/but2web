# Button Two Web Assignment

## In this project I chose to create a hospital check-in. When the button is pushed, it indicates the patient is ready.

* First I created my python code using the the previous button code as reference. I simply replaced the print statement with f.write().
* I then created my HTML code to format the webpage.
* I pushed the button, and it lets you know the patient has been checked in!
